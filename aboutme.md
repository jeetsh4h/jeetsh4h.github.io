Hello, I am student of Computer Science at FLAME University.
I am pursuing an Bachelor's with Honours in Computer Science.
This is my personal website and hopefully it will be a place for me to showcase my work and research projects over the years.
Simultaneously, having a space carved out for myself on the internet where I can nerd out over the technologies I am currently interested in.

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please feel free to reach out to me on any of the social media links that are in the footer.

Here is my resume:<br>
